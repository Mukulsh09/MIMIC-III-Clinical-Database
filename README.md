This project delves into the MIMIC-III Clinical Database to discover distinct patient segments using unsupervised learning techniques. By applying K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to demographic data, lab test results, and vital signs, the analysis seeks to reveal meaningful patterns and potential clinical insights.

**Project Highlights:**

* **Data Source:** MIMIC-III Clinical Database.
* **Clustering Algorithms:** K-Means (with Elbow Method for optimal k) and Hierarchical Clustering (with multiple linkage methods).
* **Data Preprocessing:** Comprehensive handling of missing values and normalization to prepare the data for clustering.
* **Visualization:** Extensive use of visualizations (scatter plots, pair plots, dendrograms) to understand and interpret the resulting clusters.
* **Comparative Analysis:** A detailed comparison of the clusters generated by K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.

The deliverables for this project include Python code (.ipynb), a comprehensive report (Word) detailing the methodology and findings, and high-resolution screenshots of key visualizations.
